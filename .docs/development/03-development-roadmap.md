# Development Roadmap

## Vision
Enable Claude users to orchestrate complex, parallel development workflows through intelligent task delegation.

## Strategic Phases

### Phase 1: MVP - Single Task Delegation (Weeks 1-2)
**Goal**: Prove the core value proposition  
**Outcome**: Users can delegate one background task  
**Success Metric**: 30% retention after first use

### Phase 2: Queue & Concurrency (Weeks 3-4)
**Goal**: Handle multiple tasks efficiently  
**Outcome**: Task queue with 3-5 concurrent tasks  
**Success Metric**: 50% of users delegate multiple tasks

### Phase 3: Smart Orchestration (Weeks 5-6)
**Goal**: Intelligent task management  
**Outcome**: Priorities, dependencies, worktrees  
**Success Metric**: 70% task completion rate

### Phase 4: Production Ready (Weeks 7-8)
**Goal**: Reliability and scale  
**Outcome**: Error recovery, monitoring, persistence  
**Success Metric**: <1% failure rate

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (Weeks 9+)
**Goal**: Differentiation  
**Outcome**: Templates, scheduling, collaboration  
**Success Metric**: 100+ daily active users

## Phase 1 Detail: MVP (Current Focus)

### Timeline: 2 Weeks

#### Week 1: Core Implementation
**Sprint 1.1 (Days 1-5)**
- Project initialization
- MCP server scaffold
- DelegateTask tool
- Basic process management
- Output capture

#### Week 2: Integration & Polish
**Sprint 1.2 (Days 6-10)**
- TaskStatus & TaskLogs tools
- CancelTask implementation
- Error handling
- Claude Desktop integration
- Documentation & testing

### Deliverables
1. Working MCP server
2. Four core tools (Delegate, Status, Logs, Cancel)
3. Installation guide
4. 5 example use cases

### Technical Milestones
- [ ] TypeScript project setup
- [ ] MCP server responds to requests
- [ ] Can spawn Claude Code process
- [ ] Can capture and store output
- [ ] Can query task status
- [ ] Can cancel running task
- [ ] Integrates with Claude Desktop

## Phase 2 Detail: Queue & Concurrency

### Features
- Task queue with FIFO processing
- Support 3-5 concurrent tasks
- **CLI interface for local terminal usage**
- ListTasks tool
- Basic resource limits
- Task history (last 10)

### Technical Changes
- Implement proper task queue
- Add concurrent task limit
- **Add CLI entry point with commander.js**
- **Shared state management (SQLite or JSON file)**
- File-based task history
- Memory monitoring

### Timeline: Week 3
**Sprint 2.1 (Days 11-15)**
- Days 11-12: Implement task queue and concurrency
- Day 13: Add CLI interface
- Day 14: ListTasks tool and resource limits
- Day 15: Testing and integration

---

## Phase 3 Detail: Smart Orchestration

### Features
- Priority levels (P0, P1, P2)
- Task dependencies
- Git worktree isolation
- SuspendTask/ResumeTask
- Session recovery

### Technical Changes
- Priority queue implementation
- Dependency graph resolution
- Worktree management
- Checkpoint/resume system

---

## Phase 4 Detail: Production Ready

### Features
- Persistent task state
- Crash recovery
- Resource monitoring
- Metrics dashboard
- Auto-retry logic

### Technical Changes
- SQLite for persistence
- Graceful shutdown
- Health checks
- Prometheus metrics
- Structured error codes

---

## Phase 5 Detail: Advanced Features

### Features
- Task templates
- Scheduled tasks
- Multi-user support
- Web dashboard
- Task sharing

### Technical Changes
- Template engine
- Cron scheduler
- Authentication
- REST API
- WebSocket updates

---

## Risk-Adjusted Planning

### Critical Path (Must Have)
1. MCP server foundation
2. DelegateTask tool
3. Output capture
4. Status checking

### Nice to Have (Can Defer)
1. Advanced error handling
2. Performance optimization
3. Fancy logging
4. Configuration options

### Kill Switches
- If no retention by day 5: Pivot to different workflow
- If technical blocker: Simplify architecture
- If poor performance: Reduce scope

---

## Resource Requirements

### Phase 1 (MVP)
- 1 developer
- 2 weeks
- No external dependencies
- Local testing only

### Phase 2-3
- 1-2 developers
- 4 weeks
- Early user feedback
- Basic monitoring

### Phase 4-5
- 2-3 developers
- 4+ weeks
- Production infrastructure
- User support

---

## Success Metrics by Phase

| Phase | Primary Metric | Target | Measurement |
|-------|---------------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | First-use retention | 30% | Users who delegate 2nd task |
| 2 | Multi-task usage | 50% | Users running concurrent tasks |
| 3 | Task success rate | 70% | Completed without error |
| 4 | System reliability | 99% | Uptime over 24 hours |
| 5 | Daily active users | 100+ | Unique users per day |

---

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Phase 1: Friends & Family
- 5-10 early adopters
- Direct feedback channel
- Daily iterations

### Phase 2: Private Beta
- 50 invited users
- Discord community
- Weekly releases

### Phase 3: Public Beta
- Open registration
- Documentation site
- Community support

### Phase 4: General Availability
- Marketing push
- Conference talks
- Integration partners

---

## Decision Points

### After Phase 1
- **Continue**: If retention > 20%
- **Pivot**: If users don't delegate tasks
- **Kill**: If technical issues insurmountable

### After Phase 2
- **Scale**: If concurrent usage high
- **Focus**: If single-task usage preferred
- **Enhance**: If users want specific features

### After Phase 3
- **Productize**: If metrics strong
- **Open source**: If community interest
- **Maintain**: If stable user base

## Communication Plan

### Internal
- Daily standups during sprints
- Weekly progress reports
- Phase retrospectives

### External
- Blog post at each phase
- Twitter updates on milestones
- Discord for user feedback
