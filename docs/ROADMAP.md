### v0.3.1 - Task Dependencies: Performance & Quality (Q4 2025)
**Goal**: Optimize task dependency system based on production feedback
**Priority**: High - Performance and maintainability improvements
**Status**: Planned post-v0.3.0

#### Performance Optimizations

**HIGH Priority**:
- **Batch Dependency Resolution** (2-4 hours)
  - Replace N+1 queries with single batch UPDATE + JOIN
  - Estimated improvement: 7-10√ó faster for tasks with many dependents
  - Impact: Critical for tasks with 10+ dependents

- **Multi-Dependency Transactions** (1-2 hours)
  - Wrap multiple dependency additions in single atomic transaction
  - Prevents partial state when adding multiple dependencies fails mid-way
  - Impact: Ensures consistency for complex dependency chains

- **Input Validation Limits** (30 minutes)
  - Max 100 dependencies per task (prevent DoS)
  - Max 100 dependency chain depth (prevent stack overflow)
  - Impact: Security hardening for production deployment

**MEDIUM Priority**:
- **Incremental Graph Updates** (3-4 hours)
  - Avoid O(N) findAll() query on every dependency addition
  - Maintain in-memory graph with incremental updates
  - Estimated improvement: 70-80% reduction in dependency addition latency

- **Parallel Dependency Validation** (1-2 hours)
  - Validate multiple dependencies concurrently using Promise.all()
  - Estimated improvement: 30-40% reduction in task delegation latency

- **Transitive Query Memoization** (1-2 hours)
  - Cache results of getAllDependencies() and getAllDependents()
  - Estimated improvement: 90%+ for monitoring/dashboard queries
  - Impact: Significant benefit for administrative queries

#### Architecture Refinements

**MEDIUM Priority**:
- **Remove Cycle Detection from Repository Layer** (3-4 hours)
  - Move all business logic validation to DependencyHandler
  - Repository becomes pure data access layer
  - Impact: Cleaner separation of concerns, better testability

- **Consolidate Graph Caching** (2 hours)
  - Single cache in service layer (remove repository cache)
  - Eliminates dual cache invalidation complexity
  - Impact: Simpler reasoning about cache correctness

**LOW Priority**:
- **Extract Error Handling Utilities** (3-4 hours)
  - DRY up ~150 lines of repeated error logging patterns
  - Create `logAndReturnError()` helper function
  - Impact: Maintainability improvement

- **Extract Event Emission Helpers** (2 hours)
  - DRY up ~80 lines of repeated event emission patterns
  - Add `BaseHandler.emitEvent()` with error handling
  - Impact: Reduced boilerplate in event handlers

#### Quality Improvements

**HIGH Priority**:
- **Complete JSDoc Coverage** (45 minutes)
  - Add @param tags to all public methods in dependency-graph.ts
  - Add complete JSDoc to dependency-repository.ts
  - Impact: Better IDE autocomplete and developer experience

- **Integration Test Gaps** (1 hour)
  - Add QueueHandler integration test (blocked tasks ‚Üí unblocked ‚Üí queued)
  - Add end-to-end multi-level dependency chain test
  - Add failed/cancelled dependency propagation tests
  - Impact: Critical production scenarios validated

**MEDIUM Priority**:
- **Database Constraints** (15 minutes + migration)
  - Add CHECK constraint for resolution enum values
  - Defense-in-depth validation at database level
  - Impact: Additional data integrity protection

#### Behavioral Clarifications

**Documentation Needed**:
- **Failed Dependency Semantics**: Document what happens when dependency fails
  - Options: Auto-fail dependents, auto-cancel dependents, or leave queued
  - Current behavior: Dependency marked "failed", dependent tasks remain blocked
  - Decision needed: Should dependents auto-fail or require manual intervention?

- **Cancelled Dependency Propagation**: Define cascade behavior
  - Should cancelling a task cascade to all dependents?
  - Or should dependents remain blocked until manually cancelled?

#### Success Metrics
- [ ] Batch resolution implemented - 10√ó improvement measured
- [ ] JSDoc coverage 100% for public APIs
- [ ] Integration test coverage for QueueHandler
- [ ] Performance benchmarks added to CI
- [ ] Zero reported dependency deadlocks in production
- [ ] Documentation covers failed dependency behavior

### v0.4.0 - Task Resumption & Scheduling (Q1 2026)
**Goal**: Production-ready workflow automation with recovery and scheduling
**Priority**: High - Critical for production reliability

#### Task Resumption üîÑ
Resume failed or interrupted tasks from last checkpoint, preserving conversation context and partial work.

**Features**:
- **Session Continuation**: Resume Claude tasks from failure/interruption points
- **Checkpoint Mechanism**: Automatic checkpoints every N tool calls or minutes
- **State Recovery**: Preserve conversation history, tool calls, and git state
- **Conflict Detection**: Detect external file changes during task downtime
- **Smart Restart**: Resume with context: "Previous attempt failed at step X..."

**Use Cases**:
- Long-running refactors that fail midway ‚Üí Resume instead of restart
- Server crashes during task ‚Üí Recover partial work automatically
- Network interruptions ‚Üí Continue where left off

**Complexity**: HIGH - Research phase required
- **Unknown**: Does Claude API support session continuation?
- **Fallback**: "Retry with context injection" if full resumption not feasible
- **Timeline**: 2-3 days research + 3-4 weeks implementation (or 1 week for fallback)

**Implementation** (Tentative):
```typescript
// Resume failed task from checkpoint
const result = await taskManager.resumeTask(taskId, {
  from: 'last-checkpoint',
  preserveHistory: true,
  conflictResolution: 'fail'  // or 'merge' | 'override'
});
```

**Database**:
- New `task_sessions` table for checkpoints
- Store: conversation_history, tool_calls, git_state
- Checkpoint triggers: Every 10 tool calls, every 5 minutes, before risky operations

**Decision Gate**: Research Claude API capabilities before full implementation commitment

#### Task Scheduling ‚è∞
Execute tasks at specific times or recurring intervals using cron-like scheduling.

**Features**:
- **Cron Syntax**: Standard cron expressions for recurring tasks
- **One-Time Scheduling**: ISO timestamp for delayed execution
- **Time Zone Support**: IANA timezone handling with DST awareness
- **Missed Run Policies**: Skip, catchup, or fail after server downtime
- **Schedule History**: Track all executions and failures
- **Dependency Integration**: Scheduled tasks can depend on other tasks

**Use Cases**:
- Daily backups at 2am
- Weekly reports every Monday
- One-time production deployment tomorrow at 8am
- Recurring maintenance with dependency chains

**Complexity**: MEDIUM-LOW - Well-understood problem
- **Libraries**: Use `cron-parser` for cron expression handling
- **Timeline**: 4-6 days (1 week)

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Daily backup at 2am
await taskManager.scheduleTask({
  schedule: '0 2 * * *',  // Cron syntax
  task: { prompt: "Backup database to S3" },
  timezone: 'America/New_York',
  missedRunPolicy: 'catchup'
});

// One-time delayed execution
await taskManager.scheduleTask({
  schedule: '2025-10-16T08:00:00Z',
  task: { prompt: "Deploy to production" },
  recurring: false
});
```

**Database**:
- New `scheduled_tasks` table: schedule, next_run_time, recurring, timezone
- New `schedule_history` table: execution history and audit trail
- Timer-based execution: Check every minute for due tasks

#### Timeline
- **Week 1-2**: Research Task Resumption feasibility (Claude API session support)
- **Week 3-5**: Implement Task Resumption (full or fallback) OR defer if not feasible
- **Week 6**: Implement Task Scheduling
- **Total**: 6 weeks

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] Task Resumption: Can resume from checkpoint within 30 seconds (if implemented)
- [ ] Task Resumption: Fallback "retry with context" working (minimum viable)
- [ ] Task Scheduling: Tasks execute within 1 minute of scheduled time
- [ ] Task Scheduling: Recurring tasks repeat correctly
- [ ] Integration: Scheduled tasks can have dependencies
