# Refactoring Decision - Full SOLID Architecture

**Date**: 2025-08-18  
**Decision**: Full Refactor (Option 1)  
**Checkpoint Commit**: `a952c21af25fa4d4e843cd47065c6f624f9884b4`

## Decision Context

Before implementing autoscaling, we evaluated three approaches:

### Option 1: Full Refactor First (2-3 days) âœ… CHOSEN
- Extract 5-6 clean modules following SOLID principles
- Implement Result types everywhere
- Full dependency injection
- Complete separation of concerns
- **Risk**: Delays autoscaling feature by 2-3 days
- **Benefit**: Clean, maintainable, testable architecture

### Option 2: Pragmatic Refactor (4-6 hours)
**Just the essentials for autoscaling:**
1. Extract `TaskQueue` class (30 min)
2. Extract `ProcessSpawner` interface (30 min)
3. Extract `ResourceMonitor` class (1 hour)
4. Create `WorkerPool` to manage multiple tasks (1 hour)
5. Keep existing MCP handler, just inject dependencies (1 hour)
6. Add Result types only for new code (ongoing)

### Option 3: Build Autoscaling on Current Code (2-4 hours)
- Quick and dirty implementation
- Will make future refactoring harder
- Technical debt accumulates
- Not recommended

## Why We Chose Full Refactor

1. **Current code is only ~400 lines** - manageable refactor scope
2. **No existing tests** - we won't break compatibility
3. **Early in project lifecycle** - best time to establish patterns
4. **Autoscaling needs clean architecture** - multiple workers require proper state management
5. **Following our principles** - CLAUDE.md emphasizes clean code from the start

## Rollback Strategy

If the full refactor proves too complex or time-consuming:

```bash
# This commit contains the last working state before refactor
git checkout [checkpoint-commit-hash]

# Create new branch for pragmatic approach
git checkout -b feature/autoscaling-pragmatic

# Implement Option 2 (pragmatic refactor) instead
```

## Success Criteria for Full Refactor

- [ ] Zero `any` types in codebase
- [ ] All business logic returns Result types (no throws)
- [ ] Full dependency injection
- [ ] Each class has single responsibility
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage
- [ ] Immutable state management
- [ ] Structured JSON logging
- [ ] Performance benchmarks in place

## Timeline

### Day 1 (Today)
- Morning: Core types and Result utilities
- Afternoon: Extract interfaces and modules

### Day 2
- Morning: Implement dependency injection
- Afternoon: Functional composition, pipes

### Day 3
- Morning: Integration tests
- Afternoon: Performance benchmarks, cleanup

## Notes

- We're committing to quality over speed
- This refactor will make all future features easier
- The architecture will support distributed processing later
- We can always fall back to Option 2 if needed
