## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: MVP Metrics (Week 1-2)

**Minimal Tracking**
```typescript
interface BasicMetrics {
  userId: string;           // Anonymous ID
  action: 'delegate' | 'status' | 'logs' | 'cancel';
  taskId: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  success: boolean;
  errorType?: string;
}
```

**Storage**: Local JSON file
```json
{
  "metrics": [
    {
      "userId": "anon-123",
      "action": "delegate",
      "taskId": "task-456",
      "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "success": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### Data Collection Points

1. **On DelegateTask**
   - User ID (anonymous)
   - Timestamp
   - Task ID generated
   - Success/failure

2. **On TaskStatus**
   - Task ID
   - Status returned
   - Time since delegation

3. **On TaskLogs**
   - Task ID
   - Output size
   - Time to retrieve

4. **On CancelTask**
   - Task ID
   - Time running before cancel
   - Reason (if provided)

5. **On Process Events**
   - Task completion time
   - Exit code
   - Output size
   - Error messages
