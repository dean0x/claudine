# Test Analysis Report

## Overview
This document analyzes test failures found during comprehensive testing of the Claudine codebase.

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests (`tests/unit/`)
**Status**: 17/19 test files passing, 29 individual test failures

#### Key Issues Found:

##### A. Mock Setup Issues (Critical)
**Files affected**:
- `autoscaling-manager.test.ts` - 4 failures
- `event-handlers.test.ts` - 25 failures

**Root Cause**: Mock objects not properly initialized
- `mockWorkers.getActiveCount` is undefined
- `mockMonitor.getCPUUsage` is undefined
- `this.logger.info is not a function` - logger mock incomplete

**Pattern**: Tests are trying to call `.mockReturnValue()` on undefined properties

##### B. Missing Task Data in Repository
**Files affected**:
- `event-handlers.test.ts` - PersistenceHandler tests

**Issues**:
- "Task test-task not found for start update"
- "Task test-task not found for completion update"
- "Task test-task not found for failure update"

**Root Cause**: Tests expect tasks to exist in repository but don't set them up first

##### C. Event Subscription Mismatches
**Files affected**:
- `event-handlers.test.ts` - OutputHandler tests

**Issue**: Expected event subscriptions don't match actual subscriptions
- Expected: `TaskCompleted`
- Actual: `LogsRequested`, `OutputCaptured`

### 2. Stress Tests (`tests/stress/`)
**Status**: All 10 tests failing

#### Key Issues:

##### A. Outdated Configuration Pattern
**File**: `concurrent-5.test.ts`

**Issue**: Test uses `new Configuration({...})` but Configuration is a type, not a class
- The test expects a Configuration class that doesn't exist
- Uses `config.get('MAX_OUTPUT_BUFFER')` pattern that's outdated

##### B. Mismatched Constructor Signatures
**Issue**: `EventDrivenWorkerPool` constructor expects:
```typescript
(spawner, monitor, logger, eventBus, worktreeManager, outputCapture)
```
But stress test provides:
```typescript
(eventBus, processSpawner, outputCapture, resourceMonitor, config)
```

### 3. Integration Tests (`tests/integration/`)
**Status**: All test files failing

#### Key Issues:

##### A. Missing Methods on Handlers
**Files affected**:
- `event-flow.test.ts` - 6 failures
- All other integration test files

**Issues**:
- `persistenceHandler.start is not a function`
- `outputHandler.start is not a function`
- `pool.shutdown is not a function`

**Root Cause**: Test setup creates incomplete handler objects missing required methods

##### B. Recovery Test Failures
**File**: `recovery.test.ts` - 5 failures

**Issues**: Similar to event-flow tests - missing methods on mock objects

##### C. Import/Module Resolution
**Files affected**:
- `task-delegation-simple.test.ts`
- `task-delegation.test.ts`
- `task-persistence.test.ts`
- `worker-management.test.ts`

**Issue**: Module resolution failures likely due to incorrect imports

### 4. E2E Tests (`tests/e2e/`)
**Status**: Mixed results - 12 passing, ~40 failing

#### Passing Tests:
- Some CLI help commands
- Invalid command handling
- Priority validation
- Some status listing commands

#### Key Issues:

##### A. Database/State Issues
**Pattern**: Most failures related to:
- Tasks not being persisted properly
- Status commands not finding tasks
- Logs not being captured
- Cancellation not working

**Root Cause**: Likely the CLI is not properly initializing the database or the tests are not waiting for async operations

##### B. Timeout Issues
**Pattern**: Many tests taking 1-11 seconds to fail
- Suggests async operations timing out
- CLI commands not completing properly

##### C. Working Tests Show Pattern
**Observation**: Tests that pass are mostly:
- Simple validation (invalid priority)
- Help text display
- Error messages
- Commands that don't require database state

## Quality Concerns

### 1. Test Isolation
- Tests are not properly isolated - failures cascade through afterEach hooks
- Undefined objects in cleanup cause secondary failures

### 2. Mock Quality
- Many mocks are incomplete (missing methods/properties)
- Mock setup is inconsistent across tests
- Some tests rely on implementation details rather than behavior

### 3. Test Design Issues
- **Stress test**: Uses outdated patterns from a previous architecture
- **Event handler tests**: Don't properly set up prerequisites (tasks in repository)
- **Mock objects**: Created with partial implementations leading to runtime errors

### 4. Assertion Quality
- Some tests check for mock calls rather than actual behavior
- Tests are tightly coupled to implementation details

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Needed:
1. **Fix mock initialization** - Ensure all mocked methods exist before use
2. **Update stress test** - Rewrite to match current architecture
3. **Add setup helpers** - Create proper test fixtures for common scenarios
4. **Fix event handler tests** - Ensure tasks exist in repository before testing updates

### Long-term Improvements:
1. **Integration over unit tests** - Focus on testing actual behavior, not mocks
2. **Test helpers** - Create factory functions for common test setups
3. **Better isolation** - Ensure each test is independent
4. **Remove implementation coupling** - Test behavior, not internal details

## Test Count Summary
- **Unit Tests**: 262 passed, 29 failed, 18 skipped (90% pass rate)
- **Stress Tests**: 0 passed, 10 failed (0% pass rate - architecture mismatch)
- **Integration Tests**: 0 passed, ~25 failed (0% pass rate - mock issues)
- **E2E Tests**: 12 passed, ~40 failed (23% pass rate - database/async issues)

## Critical Path
The most critical issues to fix first:
1. Mock initialization in `autoscaling-manager.test.ts` and `event-handlers.test.ts`
2. Complete rewrite of `concurrent-5.test.ts` stress test
3. Fix task repository setup in persistence handler tests
