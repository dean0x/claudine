## Critical Bug Fixes

### Task Resubmission Bug Fixed üö®
- **Fixed**: Critical issue where tasks were resubmitted on every MCP server restart
- **Impact**: This bug was causing Claude instances to crash due to duplicate task execution
- **Solution**: Enhanced RecoveryManager to only restore QUEUED/RUNNING tasks, not all tasks
- **Added**: Duplicate prevention with TaskQueue.contains() method
- **Added**: Automatic cleanup of old completed tasks (7 day retention)

## Documentation Overhaul üìö

### New Documentation Files

```

### Configuration Fixes
- Updated MCP configuration examples to use correct entry points
