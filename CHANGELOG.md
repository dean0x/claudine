# Changelog

All notable changes to Delegate will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### 🚀 Performance Improvements
- **Pagination for findAll() methods**: Added `limit` and `offset` parameters to `TaskRepository.findAll()` and `DependencyRepository.findAll()` with default limit of 100 records per page
- **New findAllUnbounded() methods**: Explicit unbounded retrieval for operations that genuinely need all records (e.g., graph initialization)
- **New count() methods**: Support pagination UI with total record counts without fetching all data

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes
- **findAll() now returns max 100 results by default**: Existing code calling `findAll()` without parameters will receive paginated results. Use `findAllUnbounded()` if you need all records.

### 🏗️ Architecture
- **Explicit unbounded queries**: `DependencyHandler.create()` now uses `findAllUnbounded()` with architecture comment explaining why graph initialization requires all dependencies

## [0.3.3] - 2025-12-09

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Fixed broken npm package**: v0.3.2 was published without `dist/` directory due to stale TypeScript build cache
- **Fixed clean script**: Changed `.tsbuildinfo` to `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` to match actual TypeScript output filename

---

## [0.3.2] - 2025-12-08

### 🛠️ Technical Improvements
- **Configurable chain depth limit**: `DependencyHandler.create()` now accepts `options.maxChainDepth`
- **Database defense-in-depth**: Added CHECK constraint on `resolution` column via migration v2
- **Type safety**: Explicit `DependencyRow` and `TaskRow` interfaces replace `Record<string, any>`

### 🗑️ Removed
- **Dead code cleanup**: Removed unused `getQueueStats()`, `getNextTask()`, `requeueTask()` methods from QueueHandler

### 📚 Documentation
- Fixed incorrect `getMaxDepth()` complexity claim (was "O(1) cached", now "O(V+E) with memoization")

---

## [0.3.1] - 2025-12-01

### 🔒 Security Fixes
- **CRITICAL: Graph Corruption Fix (Issue #28)**: Deep copy in `wouldCreateCycle()` prevents dependency graph corruption
  - Shallow copy (`new Map(this.graph)`) corrupted dependency graph because Set values remained as references
  - Cycle detection could permanently add edges to the graph, causing unpredictable task execution
  - Fixed with proper deep copy: `new Map(Array.from(this.graph.entries()).map(([k, v]) => [k, new Set(v)]))`
- **npm audit vulnerabilities fixed**: Resolved 3 security issues (1 HIGH, 2 MODERATE)
  - glob CLI command injection (HIGH) - GHSA-5j98-mcp5-4vw2
  - body-parser denial of service (MODERATE) - GHSA-wqch-xfxh-vrr4
  - vite path traversal on Windows (MODERATE) - GHSA-93m4-6634-74q7
- **Configuration validation logging**: No longer silently falls back to defaults when env vars fail validation

### 🚀 Performance Improvements
- **Settling workers tracking**: Prevents spawn burst overload during high-load scenarios
  - Load average is a 1-minute rolling average that doesn't reflect recent spawns
  - New `recordSpawn()` tracks workers in 15-second settling window
  - Projects resource usage including workers not yet reflected in metrics
  - Increased `minSpawnDelayMs` from 50ms to 1000ms for additional protection

### 🛠️ Technical Improvements
- **Type safety**: Replaced `any` type with `Worker` in `getWorkerStats()` return type
- **Test compatibility**: Added `recordSpawn()` to TestResourceMonitor
- **🔒 Input Validation Limits (Issue #12)**: Security hardening for dependency system
  - Maximum 100 dependencies per task to prevent DoS attacks
  - Maximum 100 dependency chain depth to prevent stack overflow
  - Clear error messages with current counts and limits
  - Validation enforced at repository level for consistency
- **🔄 Atomic Multi-Dependency Transactions (Issue #11)**: Data consistency improvements
  - New `addDependencies()` batch method with atomic all-or-nothing semantics
  - Transaction rollback on any validation failure (cycle detection, duplicate, task not found)
  - Prevents partial dependency state in database
  - DependencyHandler updated to use atomic batch operations
- **📊 Chain Depth Calculation**: New `DependencyGraph.getMaxDepth()` algorithm
  - DFS with memoization for O(V+E) complexity
  - Handles diamond-shaped graphs efficiently
  - Used for security validation of chain depth limits

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Command Injection**: Fixed potential security vulnerabilities in git operations
- **Test Reliability**: Fixed flaky tests with proper mocking
- **Parameter Consistency**: Aligned CLI and MCP tool parameters

### 🧪 Test Coverage
- **5 new tests** for settling workers tracking in ResourceMonitor
- **3 regression tests** for graph immutability after cycle checks
- **18 tests** for v0.3.1 security and consistency improvements:
  - 11 tests for atomic batch dependency operations (rollback, validation)
  - 3 tests for max dependencies per task validation (100 limit)
  - 1 test for max chain depth validation (100 limit)
  - 7 tests for DependencyGraph.getMaxDepth() algorithm

### 📚 Documentation
- Updated `docs/architecture/TASK_ARCHITECTURE.md` with correct deep copy pattern
- Fixed stale line numbers in `docs/TASK-DEPENDENCIES.md` (wouldCreateCycle at line 240)
