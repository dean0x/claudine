# Changelog

All notable changes to Claudine will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.1] - 2025-09-02

### üêõ Critical Bug Fixes
- **Task Resubmission Bug**: Fixed critical issue where tasks were resubmitted on every MCP server restart, causing Claude instances to crash
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Added `contains()` method to TaskQueue to prevent duplicate task processing
- **Database Recovery**: Improved RecoveryManager to only restore QUEUED/RUNNING tasks, not all tasks
- **Cleanup Logic**: Added automatic cleanup of old completed tasks (7 day retention) on startup
- **Output Buffer Logic**: Fixed bug where zero buffer size configurations were ignored due to falsy value handling

### üìö Documentation Overhaul  
- **FEATURES.md**: New comprehensive documentation of all implemented features
- **ROADMAP.md**: Unified roadmap replacing 3+ conflicting versions
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Added proper version history and migration guides
- **Documentation Cleanup**: Archived outdated/conflicting documentation in `.docs/archive/`
- **README.md**: Updated to accurately reflect v0.2.1 capabilities
- **CLAUDE.md**: Updated with current architecture information

### üõ†Ô∏è Build & Development
- **Package Scripts**: Added missing npm scripts that were documented but didn't exist:
  - `npm run test:comprehensive` - Run tests with coverage
  - `npm run test:coverage` - Same as above for compatibility
  - `npm run validate` - Full validation pipeline (typecheck + build + test)
- **Configuration Examples**: Fixed MCP configuration examples to use correct entry points

### üí° Technical Improvements
- **Mock Factories**: Updated test mock factories with new methods (cleanupOldTasks, contains)
- **Type Safety**: Enhanced TaskRepository and TaskQueue interfaces
- **Error Handling**: Better error separation in RecoveryManager

### üìù Notes
- No breaking changes - fully backward compatible with v0.2.0
- All MCP tools continue to work exactly the same
- Database migration is automatic on first startup

## [0.2.0] - 2025-09-02

### üöÄ Added
- **Task Persistence**: SQLite database with automatic task recovery on startup
