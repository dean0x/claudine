# 🚀 Claudine v0.2.2 - Enhanced Reliability & Developer Experience

## Major Features

- **🔄 Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff**: Smart retry mechanism for transient failures in git operations and GitHub API calls, improving reliability in unstable network conditions
- **🏷️ Process Naming**: Easy process identification with named processes (`claudine-cli`, `claudine-mcp`) and environment variables for workers, enabling better process management
- **🌳 Git Worktree Support**: Branch-based task isolation using git worktrees prevents conflicts between parallel tasks
- **🐙 GitHub Integration**: Automatic PR creation from task results with configurable merge strategies and custom PR titles/descriptions

## Improvements

- **CLI/MCP Parameter Alignment**: Full parameter parity between CLI and MCP tools
  - Added `--tail` parameter to logs command
  - Added `reason` parameter to cancel command
- **Error Handling**: Fixed deprecated `listTasks()` method usage in CLI status command
