## Why Claudine Exists

**The Problem**: Claude Code is incredibly powerful, but you can only work on one thing at a time with a single claude code instance. This kills true multitasking and orchestration.

**Our Belief**: AI should scale with your ambition, not limit it. Why use only one Claude instance?

**The Vision**: Transform your machine or dedicated server into an AI powerhouse where you orchestrate multiple Claude Code instances through one main session. Work on authentication in repo A while simultaneously building APIs in repo B, all coordinated through your primary Claude Code interface - no context pollution, no workflow interruption.

## Features

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Coordinates components through events, eliminating race conditions
- **Intelligent Resource Management**: Monitors CPU and memory in real-time, spawning workers when resources are available
- **Task Persistence & Recovery**: SQLite storage with automatic crash recovery
- **Task Dependencies**: DAG-based dependency resolution with cycle detection
- **Task Scheduling**: Cron and one-time scheduling with timezone support and missed run policies
- **Task Resumption**: Resume failed/completed tasks with enriched context from automatic checkpoints

See **[FEATURES.md](./docs/FEATURES.md)** for complete feature list.

## Usage

### MCP Tools

Once configured, use these tools in Claude Code:

| Tool | Description | Usage |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **DelegateTask** | Submit tasks to background instances | `DelegateTask({ prompt: "...", priority: "P1" })` |
| **TaskStatus** | Get real-time task status | `TaskStatus({ taskId })` |
| **TaskLogs** | Stream or retrieve execution logs | `TaskLogs({ taskId })` |
| **CancelTask** | Cancel tasks with resource cleanup | `CancelTask({ taskId, reason })` |
| **ScheduleTask** | Schedule recurring or one-time tasks | `ScheduleTask({ prompt: "...", scheduleType: "cron", cronExpression: "0 2 * * *" })` |
| **ListSchedules** | List schedules with optional status filter | `ListSchedules({ status: "active" })` |
| **GetSchedule** | Get schedule details and execution history | `GetSchedule({ scheduleId })` |
| **CancelSchedule** | Cancel an active schedule | `CancelSchedule({ scheduleId, reason })` |
| **PauseSchedule** | Pause a schedule (resumable) | `PauseSchedule({ scheduleId })` |
| **ResumeSchedule** | Resume a paused schedule | `ResumeSchedule({ scheduleId })` |
| **ResumeTask** | Resume a failed/completed task with checkpoint context | `ResumeTask({ taskId, additionalContext? })` |

### CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `claudine mcp start` | Start the MCP server |
| `claudine delegate <task>` | Submit new task |
| `claudine status [task-id]` | Check task status (all tasks if no ID) |
| `claudine logs <task-id>` | View task output |
| `claudine cancel <task-id>` | Cancel running task |
| `claudine schedule create <prompt>` | Create a cron or one-time schedule |
| `claudine schedule list` | List schedules with optional status filter |
| `claudine schedule get <id>` | Get schedule details and execution history |
| `claudine schedule pause <id>` | Pause an active schedule |
| `claudine schedule resume <id>` | Resume a paused schedule |
| `claudine schedule cancel <id>` | Cancel a schedule |
| `claudine pipeline <prompt> ...` | Create chained one-time schedules with delays |
| `claudine resume <task-id>` | Resume a task from its checkpoint |
| `claudine help` | Show help |

### Task Dependencies

Create workflows where tasks wait for dependencies to complete:

```bash
# Step 1: Create build task
claudine delegate "npm run build" --priority P1
# → task-abc123

# Step 2: Create test task that waits for build
claudine delegate "npm test" --depends-on task-abc123
# Task waits for build to complete before running

# Step 3: Create deploy task that waits for tests
claudine delegate "npm run deploy" --depends-on task-def456
# Execution order: build → test → deploy
```

**Multiple dependencies** (parallel execution):

```typescript
// lint and format run in parallel
const lint = await DelegateTask({ prompt: "npm run lint" });
const format = await DelegateTask({ prompt: "npm run format" });

// commit waits for both to complete
const commit = await DelegateTask({
  prompt: "git commit -m 'Formatted and linted'",
  dependsOn: [lint.taskId, format.taskId]
});
```

See **[Task Dependencies Documentation](./docs/TASK-DEPENDENCIES.md)** for advanced patterns (diamond dependencies, error handling, failure propagation).

### Task Scheduling

Schedule tasks for future or recurring execution:

```typescript
// Recurring: daily backup at 2am EST
await ScheduleTask({
  prompt: "Backup database to S3",
  scheduleType: "cron",
  cronExpression: "0 2 * * *",
  timezone: "America/New_York",
  missedRunPolicy: "catchup"
});

// One-time: deploy tomorrow at 8am UTC
await ScheduleTask({
  prompt: "Deploy to production",
  scheduleType: "one_time",
  scheduledAt: "2026-02-19T08:00:00Z"
});
```

**Schedule types**: `cron` (5-field expressions) and `one_time` (ISO 8601 datetime). **Missed run policies**: `skip`, `catchup`, `fail`. Supports IANA timezones and concurrent execution prevention.

### Task Resumption

Resume failed or completed tasks with enriched context from automatic checkpoints:

```bash
# Resume a failed task
claudine resume task-abc123

# Resume with additional instructions
claudine resume task-abc123 --context "Try a different approach this time"
```

```typescript
// Via MCP
await ResumeTask({
  taskId: "task-abc123",
  additionalContext: "Focus on the database migration step"
});
```

Checkpoints are captured automatically on task completion/failure, preserving git state (branch, SHA, dirty files) and the last 50 lines of output. Resumed tasks receive the full checkpoint context in their prompt and track lineage via `parentTaskId` and `retryOf` fields.

## Architecture

**Event-driven system** with autoscaling workers and SQLite persistence. Components communicate through a central EventBus, eliminating race conditions and direct state management.

**Task Lifecycle**: `Queued` → `Running` → `Completed` / `Failed` / `Cancelled`

See **[Architecture Documentation](./docs/architecture/)** for implementation details.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Range | Description |
|----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `TASK_TIMEOUT` | 1800000 (30min) | 1000-86400000 | Task timeout in milliseconds |
| `MAX_OUTPUT_BUFFER` | 10485760 (10MB) | 1024-1073741824 | Output buffer size in bytes |
| `CPU_THRESHOLD` | 80 | 1-100 | CPU usage threshold percentage |
| `MEMORY_RESERVE` | 1073741824 (1GB) | 0+ | Memory reserve in bytes |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | info | debug/info/warn/error | Logging verbosity |

### Per-Task Configuration

Override limits for individual tasks:

```typescript
// Long-running task with larger buffer
await DelegateTask({
  prompt: "analyze large dataset",
  timeout: 7200000,           // 2 hours
  maxOutputBuffer: 104857600  // 100MB
});

// Quick task with minimal resources
await DelegateTask({
  prompt: "run eslint",
  timeout: 30000,             // 30 seconds
  maxOutputBuffer: 1048576    // 1MB
});
```

## Development

### Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev        # Development mode with auto-reload
npm run build      # Build TypeScript
npm start          # Run built server
npm run typecheck  # Type checking
npm run clean      # Clean build artifacts
```

### Testing

Tests are grouped to prevent memory exhaustion. `npm test` is blocked as a safety measure.

```bash
# Grouped tests (fast, safe to run individually)
npm run test:core           # Core domain logic (~3s)
npm run test:handlers       # Service handlers (~3s)
npm run test:repositories   # Data layer (~2s)
npm run test:adapters       # MCP adapter (~2s)
npm run test:implementations # Other implementations (~2s)
npm run test:cli            # CLI tests (~2s)
npm run test:integration    # Integration tests

# Full suite (local terminal / CI only)
npm run test:all            # All tests
npm run test:coverage       # With coverage
```
