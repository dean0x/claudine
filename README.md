## Why Claudine Exists

**The Problem**: Claude Code is incredibly powerful, but you can only work on one thing at a time. This kills true multitasking and orchestration:

- **No parallel feature development** - Can't work on authentication while simultaneously building the API layer
- **Cross-repository workflow breaks** - Switch from frontend to backend repo? Your main session context gets polluted by the detour
- **Session context pollution** - Get sidetracked debugging? Your original feature work context is contaminated and lost
- **No true orchestration** - Can't coordinate multiple Claude instances to work on interconnected parts of your system
- **Single-threaded thinking** - Complex products require parallel workstreams, but Claude Code forces linear execution
- **Context juggling overhead** - Constantly losing mental models when forced to switch between unrelated codebases

**Our Belief**: AI should scale with your ambition, not limit it. why use only one Claude instance?

**The Vision**: Transform your machine or dedicated server into an AI powerhouse where you orchestrate multiple Claude Code instances through one main session. Work on authentication in repo A while simultaneously building APIs in repo B, all coordinated through your primary Claude Code interface - no context pollution, no workflow interruption.

## How Claudine Works

**Event-Driven Architecture**: Instead of managing state directly, Claudine uses events to coordinate between components, eliminating race conditions and ensuring reliability.

**Intelligent Resource Management**: Monitors CPU and memory in real-time, spawning new Claude Code instances when resources are available, maintaining system stability.

**Task Persistence & Recovery**: Every task is stored in SQLite with automatic recovery after crashes. Your work never gets lost.

**No Artificial Limits**: Unlike traditional approaches, Claudine uses ALL available system resources - spawning as many workers as your server can handle.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.0.0+ 
- npm 10.0.0+
- Claude Code CLI installed (`claude` command available)

### System Requirements

**Minimum** (for development/testing):
- 8+ CPU cores
- 16GB RAM
- 100GB SSD

**Recommended** (for production):

- 64GB+ RAM
- 500GB+ NVMe SSD
- Dedicated Linux server (Ubuntu 22.04+)

### Installation & Configuration

#### Production Setup (Recommended)
Add to your project's `.mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "claudine": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "claudine", "mcp", "start"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Local Development
For developing Claudine itself:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "claudine": {
      "command": "node", 
      "args": ["/path/to/claudine/dist/cli.js", "mcp", "start"]
    }
  }
}
```

After adding the configuration, restart Claude Code to connect to Claudine.

## Usage

### CLI Commands

#### MCP Server Management
```bash
# Start the MCP server
claudine mcp start

# Test server startup and validation
claudine mcp test

# Show MCP configuration
claudine mcp config
```

#### Direct Task Management (New in v0.2.1)
```bash
# Delegate a task directly
claudine delegate "Create a Python script to analyze CSV data"

# Check status of all tasks
claudine status

# Check specific task status
claudine status <task-id>

# Get task logs
claudine logs <task-id>

# Cancel a running task
claudine cancel <task-id> "Taking too long"

# Show help
claudine help
```

### MCP Tools in Claude Code

Once configured, you can use Claudine's tools in Claude Code:

### Delegate a Task

```
Use DelegateTask to run: "Create a Python script that analyzes CSV data"
```

### Check Task Status

```
Use TaskStatus to check the current task
```

### Get Task Logs

```
Use TaskLogs with taskId: <task-id-here>
```

### Cancel a Task

```
Use CancelTask with taskId: <task-id-here> and reason: "Taking too long"
```

## Architecture

### Dedicated Server Design

Claudine is optimized for **dedicated servers** with ample resources, not constrained environments:

- **Autoscaling Workers**: Spawns as many Claude Code instances as your system can handle
- **Dynamic Resource Monitoring**: Continuously checks CPU and memory availability
- **Queue-Based Load Management**: Processes tasks from queue as resources become available
- **Zero Configuration**: No worker limits or tuning required

### Core Components

**Event-Driven Architecture (New in v0.2.1)**:
1. **EventBus**: Central coordination hub for all system events
2. **Event Handlers**: Specialized handlers for persistence, queue, worker, and output events
3. **MCP Server**: Handles JSON-RPC requests from Claude Code
4. **Task Manager**: Event-driven orchestrator (no direct state management)
5. **Autoscaling Manager**: Event-based worker scaling with resource monitoring
6. **Task Queue**: Priority-based queue with event-driven processing
7. **Worker Pool**: Event-driven worker lifecycle management
8. **Output Capture**: Event-based output handling with proper stdin management
9. **Task Persistence**: SQLite database with event-driven operations
10. **Recovery Manager**: Restores interrupted tasks via events on startup

### Task Lifecycle

1. **Queued**: Task waiting for available resources
2. **Running**: Claude Code process actively executing
3. **Completed**: Task finished successfully (exit code 0)
4. **Failed**: Task failed with error
5. **Cancelled**: Task manually cancelled by user

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `TASK_TIMEOUT`: Task timeout in milliseconds (default: 1800000 = 30 minutes, range: 1000-86400000)
- `MAX_OUTPUT_BUFFER`: Output buffer size in bytes (default: 10485760 = 10MB, range: 1024-1073741824)  
- `CPU_THRESHOLD`: CPU usage threshold percentage (default: 80, range: 1-100)
- `MEMORY_RESERVE`: Memory reserve in bytes (default: 1073741824 = 1GB, range: 0+)
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging level (default: 'info', options: 'debug', 'info', 'warn', 'error')

### Per-Task Configuration

You can override timeout and buffer limits for individual tasks via MCP parameters:

```javascript
// Example: Long-running task with larger buffer
await claudine.DelegateTask({
  prompt: "analyze large dataset and generate report", 
  timeout: 7200000,        // 2 hours
  maxOutputBuffer: 104857600  // 100MB
});

// Example: Quick task with minimal resources  
await claudine.DelegateTask({
  prompt: "run eslint on current file",
  timeout: 30000,          // 30 seconds
  maxOutputBuffer: 1048576    // 1MB
});
```

## Current Limitations

- No task dependency resolution (planned for v0.3.0)  
- No distributed execution across multiple machines (planned for v0.4.0)
- No web dashboard (monitoring via logs only)

For complete feature list, see [FEATURES.md](./FEATURES.md).

## Troubleshooting

### Claude CLI not found

Ensure `claude` CLI is in your PATH:
```bash
which claude
```

### Server won't start

Check logs in stderr and verify Node.js version:
```bash
node --version  # Should be v20.0.0+
```

### Tasks fail immediately

Run in development mode:
```bash
npm run dev
```
